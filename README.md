### ðŸš€ Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   cd take-home-test
   ```

2. **Start the application with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   This will:

   - Run database migrations and seed data
   - Start the API on http://localhost:5001

3. **Start the Angular frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```
   - Frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200

4. **View the application**
   - Open http://localhost:4200 to see the loan management interface
   - API documentation available at http://localhost:5001/loans

### ðŸ”§ Local Development Setup

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend/src/Fundo.Applications.WebApi

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Update connection string in appsettings.json for local SQL Server
# Run database migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Run the API
dotnet run
# API will be available at https://localhost:7001 or http://localhost:5000
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

ng serve
# Application will be available at http://localhost:4200
```

### Endpoints

#### GET /loans
Retrieve all loans

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "amount": 25000.00,
    "currentBalance": 18750.00,
    "applicantName": "John Doe",
    "status": "active"
  }
]
```

#### GET /loans/{id}
Retrieve a specific loan by ID

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "amount": 25000.00,
  "currentBalance": 18750.00,
  "applicantName": "John Doe",
  "status": "active"
}
```

#### POST /loans
Create a new loan

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": 10000.00,
  "currentBalance": 10000.00,

}
```

#### POST /loans/{id}/payment
Make a payment towards a loan

**Request Body:**
```json
500.00
```

**Notes:**
- Payment amount must be positive and not exceed current balance
- Loan status automatically changes to "paid" when balance reaches zero

{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json

## Implementation Approach

### Backend Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns with Controllers, Services (via DbContext), and Data layers
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used Code-First approach with migrations for database schema
- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraged .NET Core's built-in DI container
- **Testing Strategy**: Replaced traditional mocking with in-memory database for more realistic EF Core testing
- **Error Handling**: Implemented proper HTTP status codes and validation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Reactive Programming**: Used RxJS Observables for HTTP operations
- **Component-Based**: Single-responsibility components with clear separation of concerns
- **Service Layer**: Centralized API communication through dedicated service
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Angular Material components

### Key Design Decisions
1. **In-Memory Database for Tests**: Replaced Moq with EF Core's in-memory provider for more reliable testing
2. **CORS Configuration**: Enabled specific origin (Angular dev server) for security
3. **Docker Multi-Stage Build**: Optimized container size with separate build and runtime stages
4. **Health Checks**: Added database health checks for reliable container startup

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Testing Entity Framework with Moq
**Challenge**: Traditional mocking of DbContext and DbSet is complex and error-prone with EF Core.

**Solution**: Switched to EF Core's in-memory database provider, which provides more realistic testing scenarios and is easier to maintain.

### 2. API Route Consistency
**Challenge**: Initial implementation had inconsistent route naming between requirements (/loans) and implementation (/loan).

**Solution**: Updated controller route to match API specifications and updated all tests accordingly.

### 3. Docker Container Health Checks
**Challenge**: API container was starting before SQL Server was fully ready, causing connection failures.

**Solution**: Implemented proper health checks in docker-compose.yml with retry logic and wait conditions.

### 4. CORS Configuration
**Challenge**: Angular frontend couldn't communicate with API due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution**: Added specific CORS policy allowing the Angular development server origin with proper headers and methods.

### Advanced Features
- **Pagination**: Large dataset handling with server-side pagination
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced query capabilities for loan data
- **Audit Logging**: Track all loan modifications and payments
- **Payment History**: Detailed transaction history for each loan
- **Notification System**: Email/SMS notifications for payment reminders

### DevOps & Monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- **Structured Logging**: Serilog integration with centralized logging
- **Health Endpoints**: Comprehensive application health monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Application Insights or similar APM tools
- **Database Backup Strategy**: Automated backup and recovery procedures

### Frontend Enhancements
- **State Management**: NgRx for complex state management
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline capabilities and push notifications
- **Advanced UI**: Charts and dashboards for loan analytics
- **Print/Export**: PDF generation and Excel export functionality
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
